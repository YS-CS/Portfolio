Console Expense Tracker in Java 21

Simple console-based expense tracker that can be used to store into a text file to.

Features:
- Add expenses

How to run in Eclipse:
1. Import this folder as an Existing Project into Workspace.
2. Make sure the project uses a JavaSE-21 JRE.

This is a simple tracker that I made for practicing my Java skills and to also just to use to track some of where my money goes and on what. The expenses.csv file allows you find this stored information that can also be used to import into other porgrams such as Excel.
